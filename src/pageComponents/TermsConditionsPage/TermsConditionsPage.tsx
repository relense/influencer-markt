        <div>
          If you believe that your own copyrighted material has been mistakenly
          removed from the Site, you can submit a written counter notification
          to us using the contact information provided on our Site. To be an
          effective Counter Notification, your Counter Notification must include
          the following: (1) identification of the material that was removed or
          disabled and its former location on the Site; (2) a statement
          consenting to the jurisdiction in which we are located; (3) a
          statement that you will accept service of process from the party who
          submitted the Notification or their agent; (4) your name, address, and
          telephone number; (5) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you
          have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as
          a result of a mistake or misidentification; and (6) your physical or
          electronic signature.
        </div>
        <div>
          If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification that meets the
          requirements described above, we will restore your removed or disabled
          material unless we receive notice from the party filing the
          Notification that they have initiated a court action to prevent you
          from engaging in infringing activity related to the material.
          It&apos;s important to note that filing a false Counter Notification
          constitutes perjury, and if you materially misrepresent that the
          disabled or removed content was taken down by mistake or
          misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and
          attorney&apos;s fees.

          this clause. The arbitration panel shall consist of one (1)
          arbitrator. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be in Lisbon,
          Portugal. The proceedings shall be conducted in English. The
          substantive law of Portugal shall govern the contract.

        <div>
          The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute
          between the parties individually. To the fullest extent permitted by
          law: (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
          there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)

          arbitrate any dispute falling within that portion of this provision
          found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such dispute shall be
          decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed

          <strong>What is the Influencer Markt Referral Program?</strong>{" "}
          Influencer Markt offers a referral program by which existing Users can
          introduce people who are interested in becoming influencers or working
          with influencers to Influencer Markt and receive referral payments
          from Influencer Markt, calculated and limited as described in these
          Referral Program Terms.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>The rules of the Influencer Markt Referral Program:</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          Only Users of Influencer Markt with a current User account can
          participate in the Influencer Markt Referral Program. If a User&apos;s
          account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or
          deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in
          the Influencer Markt Referral Program. Each User has a unique referral
          link (which can be accessed via the User&apos;s User account) that the
          User may share with others. When sharing your unique referral link,
          you must not impersonate Influencer Markt or give the impression that
          your referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use
          Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine
          advertising service to share or promote your unique referral link.
          Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share
          your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your Influencer
          Markt account. The Referred User must click on your unique referral
          link and then register with Influencer Markt using the same browser
          they used to click on your unique referral link. If someone registers
          with Influencer Markt without using your unique referral link, we will
          not link that account to your referral, and no referral payment will
          be made to you. The Referred User must not have opened a User account
          with Influencer Markt (whether under the same name or another name)
          before clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred User is
          currently or has previously been a User of Influencer Markt, no
          referral payment will be made to you for the referral. If the Referred
          User sets up more than one User account, referral payments will only
          be made to you based on the earnings made by the Referred User from
          their first User account. No referral payments will be made to you on
          any further User accounts set up by the Referred User. No referral
          payments will be made to you on any referral of a Referred User that
          we determine is owned or operated by you or is in a commercial
          relationship with you. You must provide any information we request to
          determine whether the Referred User is owned or operated by you or if
          there is a commercial relationship between you and the Referred User.{" "}
          <strong>
            You agree that when promoting Influencer Markt as a Referring User:
          </strong>
          You will not give a false impression of Influencer Markt, the
          services, programs, and content (including Content) made available
          through Influencer Markt, its Users, or the Terms of Service. You will
          not make any statements that suggest to a potential Referred User that
          they will make a specific sum of money (or any money) from their use
          of Influencer Markt, or any statements regarding the likely number of
          sales.

          <strong>Referral payments:</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          How are referral payments calculated? Once a Referred User becomes a
          registered User of Influencer Markt in accordance with the rules of
          the Influencer Markt Referral Program described above, we will pay the
          Referring User a referral payment equal to fifty percent of Influencer
          Markt&apos;s net profit on the transaction, up to ten percent of the
          total transaction. Referring Users are only entitled to payments for
          completed transactions as determined by Influencer Markt.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>How frequently are referral payments made?</strong>
          We will transfer the referral payment due to you on orders completed

          of the next calendar month. For your first payment, you may need to

          payment.

          <strong>Our rights relating to the referral program:</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          If referral payments have been made incorrectly, we have the right to
          recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid
          sums have been paid. We may request you or Referred Users (or both) to
          provide us with ID and other information reasonably required by us to
          verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any
          referral payment should be made. Failure to provide requested
          information may result in the loss of your entitlement to referral
          payments for the relevant Referred User. We may change any aspect of
          the Influencer Markt Referral Program (including how referral payments
          are calculated) or discontinue the Influencer Markt Referral Program
          at any time. However, no change will deprive any Referring User of
          referral payments already earned based on payments made to Referred
          Users before the changes came into effect.

            Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:
          </strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          We may withhold all or part of the referral payments due to you but
          not yet paid out if we believe that you have seriously or repeatedly
          breached any part of the Terms of Service, or if your breach or
          threatened breach could have serious consequences for us or another
          User. We may also withhold referral payments if we suspect that all or
          part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful
          activity. We will withhold payments for as long as necessary to
          investigate any breaches or suspected unlawful activity. If we
          determine that you have breached the Terms of Service, or if the
          referral payments are found to result from unlawful activity, you may
          forfeit all or part of your referral payments. We are not responsible
          to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the
          Influencer Markt Referral Program when we have the right to do so
          under these Referral Program Terms. If we are withholding all or part
          of the referral payments due to you and determine that part of the
          withheld payments is unrelated to breaches of the Terms of Service or
          suspected unlawful activity, we may pay you the part of the referral
          payments that is unrelated. However, if we consider that your
          breach(es) of the Terms of Service have caused us loss, we may
          withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and set off
          such amounts against any losses suffered by us.

        <div>
          Upon placing an order with an influencer on the Influencer Markt,
          influencers must submit the requested work through the site in order
          to receive their funds. Upon submission of work, the buyer will have
          48 hours to ask for a revision from the influencer or dispute the work
          with Influencer Markt before the order is automatically closed and the
          money is paid to the influencer. If the influencer (seller) submits
          the required deliverables for the order, the brand (buyer) may not
          receive a refund for the order. All disputes are handled by the
          Influencer Markt arbitration team. The influencer shall not make the
          work public before receiving final approval from the buyer or before
          the expiration of 48 hours. In case of non-compliance, we reserve the
          right to withhold payment if the buyer is not satisfied. All dispute
          decisions are final and are at the sole discretion of the Influencer
          Markt arbitration team. Influencer Markt is not responsible for any
          lost product or funds. If you choose to send anything, such as a
          physical product, to an influencer to assist them with the
          collaboration, you are responsible for all costs associated with that.

          Influencer Markt can only pay influencers out via Stripe; any other
          payment methods are not supported. If a buyer or seller chooses to

          Markt does not take any responsibility for the order.

          Influencer Markt holds the right to refund any payment made to an

          In the event a product is shipped to an influencer and the work is not

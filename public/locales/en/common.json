If a User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in the Influencer Markt Referral Program. Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) that the User may share with others. When sharing your unique referral link, you must not impersonate Influencer Markt or give the impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or promote your unique referral link. Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your Influencer Markt account. The Referred User must click on your unique referral link and then register with Influencer Markt using the same browser they used to click on your unique referral link. If someone registers with Influencer Markt without using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your referral, and no referral payment will be made to you. The Referred User must not have opened a User account with Influencer Markt (whether under the same name or another name) before clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred User is currently or has previously been a User of Influencer Markt, no referral payment will be made to you for the referral. If the Referred User sets up more than one User account, referral payments will only be made to you based on the earnings made by the Referred User from their first User account. No referral payments will be made to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred User. No referral payments will be made to you on any referral of a Referred User that we determine is owned or operated by you or is in a commercial relationship with you.
